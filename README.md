Hello!

This is a project with the goal of creating a simple version of the game "Snake" using SDL2 with C++. Once the game is feature-complete, I hope to also implement an algorithm that is always able to "win" the game by playing until the snake ocupies every tile on the board. Any feedback is appreciated; I am working on this project to increase my knowledge of SDL2 and my coding knowledge in general. Thanks!
